# Airgead Banking App - Investment Growth Calculator

## Project Overview:

This C++ program is designed to help users understand the potential growth of their investment(s) over time. It calculates and displays the future value of their investment(s) based on the initial investment amount, monthly deposit amount, annual interest rate, and the number of years the investment will grow. This tool aims to provide users with valuable insights into how their savings or investments could accumulate, assisting in financial planning and decision-making.

## The Features:

- Interactive user input for investment details.
- Calculation of investment growth with and without additional monthly deposits.
- Clear, annual breakdown of the investment's growth and interest earned.

## Strengths:

- **User Interaction**: The program engages users through interactive prompts for input, enhancing the user experience.
- **Output Clarity**: It presents a well-organized output, making it easy for users to understand their investment's growth trajectory.
- **Modularity**: Functions are utilized to organize code logically, improving maintainability and readability.

## Areas for Enhancement:

- **Input Validation**: Implementing robust input validation could improve the program's resilience against invalid user inputs.
- **Use of Object-Oriented Programming**: Adopting OOP principles, such as encapsulating investment details in a class, could enhance code organization and scalability.
- **Performance Optimization**: Exploring more efficient calculation methods or data structures could improve the program's performance, especially for complex scenarios.

## Reflection:

### Challenges and Solutions:

Implementing accurate calculations for compound interest with monthly contributions required thoughtful loop and variable management, which was overcome by detailed planning and referencing financial calculation guides.

### Transferable Skills:

- The problem-solving approach and algorithm development are skills that will benefit future projects and challenges.
- Writing clean, modular code and focusing on user experience are practices that enhance any software development project.

### Maintaining Code Quality:

- **Organization**: Functions and clear commenting practices were employed to keep the code organized and understandable.
- **Consistency**: A consistent coding style and naming conventions were maintained throughout my project.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments and documentation were included to ease future modifications and maintenance.
